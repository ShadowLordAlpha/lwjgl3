		Creates a swapchain.

		A {@code VkSwapchainKHR} object (a.k.a. swapchain) provides the ability to present rendering results to a surface. A swapchain is an abstraction for an
		array of presentable images that are associated with a surface. The swapchain images are represented by {@code VkImage} objects created by the
		platform. One image (which $can be an array image for multiview/stereoscopic-3D surfaces) is displayed at a time, but multiple images $can be queued
		for presentation. An application renders to the image, and then queues the image for presentation to the surface. A native window $cannot be associated
		with more than one swapchain at a time. Further, swapchains $cannot be created for native windows that have a non-Vulkan graphics API surface
		associated with them.

		The presentation engine is an abstraction for the platform’s compositor or hardware/software display engine.

		The presentation engine may: be synchronous or asynchronous with respect to the application and/or logical device.

		${note("Some implementations may use the device’s graphics queue or dedicated presentation hardware to perform presentation.")}

		The presentable images of a swapchain are owned by the presentation engine. An application $can acquire use of a presentable image from the
		presentation engine. Use of a presentable image $must occur only after the image is returned by #AcquireNextImageKHR(), and before it is presented by
		#QueuePresentKHR(). This includes transitioning the image layout and rendering commands.

		An application $can acquire use of a presentable image with #AcquireNextImageKHR(). After acquiring a presentable image and before modifying it, the
		application $must use a synchronization primitive to ensure that the presentation engine has finished reading from the image. The application $can then
		transition the image's layout, queue rendering commands to it, etc. Finally, the application presents the image with #QueuePresentKHR(), which releases
		the acquisition of the image.

		The presentation engine controls the order in which presentable images are acquired for use by the application.

		${note(
			"""
			This allows the platform to handle situations which require out-of-order return of images after presentation. At the same time, it allows the
			application to generate command buffers referencing all of the images in the swapchain at initialization time, rather than in its main loop.

		Like core functions, several WSI fuctions, including {@code vkCreateSwapchainKHR} return #ERROR_DEVICE_LOST if the logical device was lost. As with
		most core objects, {@code VkSwapchainKHR} is a child of the device and is affected by the lost state; it $must be destroyed before destroying the
		{@code VkDevice}. However, {@code VkSurfaceKHR} is not a child of any {@code VkDevice} and is not otherwise affected by the lost device. After

		If {@code semaphore} is not #NULL_HANDLE, the semaphore $must be unsignaled and not have any uncompleted signal or wait operations pending. It will

		typically applications should: include the semaphore in the {@code pWaitSemaphores} list for the queue submission that transitions the image away from
