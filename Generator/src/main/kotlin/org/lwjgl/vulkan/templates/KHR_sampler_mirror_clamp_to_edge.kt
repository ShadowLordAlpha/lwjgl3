		Extends the set of sampler address modes to include an additional mode (#SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE) that effectively uses a texture map
		twice as large as the original image in which the additional half of the new image is a mirror image of the original image.

		This new mode relaxes the need to generate images whose opposite edges match by using the original image to generate a matching "mirror image". This
		mode allows the texture to be mirrored only once in the negative s, t, and r directions.
