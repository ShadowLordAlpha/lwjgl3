		Creates a swapchain.

		A {@code VkSwapchainKHR} object (a.k.a. swapchain) provides the ability to present rendering results to a surface. A swapchain is an abstraction for an
		array of presentable images that are associated with a surface. The swapchain images are represented by {@code VkImage} objects created by the
		platform. One image (which $can be an array image for multiview/stereoscopic-3D surfaces) is displayed at a time, but multiple images $can be queued
		for presentation. An application renders to the image, and then queues the image for presentation to the surface. A native window $cannot be associated
		with more than one swapchain at a time. Further, swapchains $cannot be created for native windows that have a non-Vulkan graphics API surface
		associated with them.

		The presentation engine is an abstraction for the platform’s compositor or hardware/software display engine.

		${note("Some implementations may use the device’s graphics queue or dedicated presentation hardware to perform presentation.")}

		images.

		When a swapchain is created, all its associated presentable images are owned by the presentation engine targeted by the swapchain. The presentation
		engine controls the order in which presentable images are available for use by the application.

		${note(
			"""
			This allows the platform to handle situations which require out-of-order return of images after presentation. At the same time, it allows the

		The availability of presentable images is influenced by factors such as the implementation of the presentation engine, the {@code VkPresentModeKHR}

		If {@code semaphore} is not VK10#NULL_HANDLE, the semaphore $must be unsignaled and not have any uncompleted signal or wait operations pending. It will

		the image contents $must wait until the semaphore signals; typically applications $should include the semaphore in the {@code pWaitSemaphores} list for
		the queue submission that transitions the image away from the #IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR layout. Use of the semaphore allows rendering operations to
