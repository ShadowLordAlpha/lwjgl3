		The Vulkan version number is used in several places in the API. In each such use, the API major version number, minor version number, and patch version
		number are packed into a 32-bit integer as follows:
		${ul(
			"The major version number is a 10-bit integer packed into bits 31-22.",
			"The minor version number is a 10-bit integer packed into bits 21-12.",
			"The patch version number is a 12-bit integer packed into bits 11-0."
		)}
		Differences in any of the Vulkan version numbers indicates a change to the API in some way, with each part of the version number indicating a different
		scope of changes.

		A difference in patch version numbers indicates that some usually small aspect of the specification or header has been modified, typically to fix a
		bug, and $may have an impact on the behavior of existing functionality. Differences in this version number $shouldnot affect either full compatibility
		or backwards compatibility between two versions, or add additional interfaces to the API.

		A difference in minor version numbers indicates that some amount of new functionality has been added. This will usually include new interfaces in the
		header, and $may also include behavior changes and bug fixes. Functionality $may be deprecated in a minor revision, but will not be removed. When a new
		minor version is introduced, the patch version is reset to 0, and each minor revision maintains its own set of patch versions. Differences in this
		version $shouldnot affect backwards compatibility, but will affect full compatibility.

		A difference in major version numbers indicates a large set of changes to the API, potentially including new functionality and header interfaces,
		behavioral changes, removal of deprecated features, modification or outright replacement of any feature, and is thus very likely to break any and all
		compatibility. Differences in this version will typically require significant modification to an application in order for it to function.

			If a set of attachments alias each other, then all except the first to be used in the render pass $must use an initialLayout of

		<h5>Pipeline Layout Compatibility</h5>

		Two pipeline layouts are defined to be “compatible for push constants” if they were created with identical push constant ranges. Two pipeline layouts
		are defined to be “compatible for set N” if they were created with matching (the same, or identically defined) descriptor set layouts for sets zero
		through N, and if they were created with identical push constant ranges.

		When binding a descriptor set  to set number N, if the previously bound descriptor sets for sets zero through N-1 were all bound using compatible
		pipeline layouts, then performing this binding does not disturb any of the lower numbered sets. If, additionally, the previous bound descriptor set for
		set N was bound using a pipeline layout compatible for set N, then the bindings in sets numbered greater than N are also not disturbed.

		Similarly, when binding a pipeline, the pipeline $can correctly access any previously bound descriptor sets which were bound with compatible pipeline
		layouts, as long as all lower numbered sets were also bound with compatible layouts.

		Layout compatibility means that descriptor sets $can be bound to a command buffer for use by any pipeline created with a compatible pipeline layout,
		and without having bound a particular pipeline first. It also means that descriptor sets $can remain valid across a pipeline change, and the same
		resources will be accessible to the newly bound pipeline.

		${note(

		Copy data between image objects.

		{@code vkCmdCopyImage} performs image copies in a similar manner to a host {@code memcpy}. It does not perform general-purpose conversions such as
		scaling, resizing, blending, color-space conversion, or format conversions. Rather, it simply copies raw image data. {@code vkCmdCopyImage} $can copy
		between images with different formats, provided the formats are compatible.

		Each region in {@code pRegions} is copied from the source image to the same region of the destination image. {@code srcImage} and {@code dstImage} $can
		be the same image or alias the same memory.

		Copies are done layer by layer starting with {@code baseArrayLayer} member of {@code srcSubresource} for the source and {@code dstSubresource} for the
		destination. {@code layerCount} layers are copied to the destination image.

		The formats of {@code srcImage} and {@code dstImage} $must be compatible. Formats are considered compatible if their texel size in bytes is the same
		between both formats. For example, #FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM is compatible with #FORMAT_R32_UINT because because both texels are 4 bytes in size.
		Depth/stencil formats $must match exactly.

		{@code vkCmdCopyImage} allows copying between size-compatible compressed and uncompressed internal formats. Formats are size-compatible if the texel
		size of the uncompressed format is equal to the block size in bytes of the compressed format. Such a copy does not perform on-the-fly compression or
		decompression. When copying from an uncompressed format to a compressed format, each texel of uncompressed data becomes a single block of compressed
		data. When copying from a compressed format to an uncompressed format, a block of compressed data becomes a single texel of uncompressed data. Thus,
		for example, it is legal to copy between a 128-bit uncompressed format and a compressed format which uses 8-bit/texel 4x4 blocks, or between a 64-bit
		uncompressed format and a compressed format which uses 4-bit/texel 4x4 blocks.

		When copying between compressed and uncompressed formats the {@code extent} members represent the texel dimensions of the source image and not the
		destination. When copying from a compressed image to an uncompressed image the image texel dimensions written to the uncompressed image will be source
		extent divided by the block size. When copying from an uncompressed image to a compressed image the image texel dimensions written to the compressed
		image will be the source extent multiplied by the block size. In both cases the number of bytes read and the number of bytes written will be identical.

		Copying to or from block-compressed images is typically done in multiples of the block. For this reason the {@code extent} $must be a multiple of the
		block dimension. There is one exception to this rule which is required to handle compressed images created with dimensions that are not a multiple of
		the block dimensions. If the {@code srcImage is} compressed and if {@code extent.width} is not a multiple of the block width then
		{@code (extent.width + srcOffset.x)} $must equal the subresource width, if {@code extent.height} is not a multiple of the block height then
		{@code (extent.height + srcOffset.y)} $must equal the subresource height and if {@code extent.depth} is not a multiple of the block depth then
		{@code (extent.depth + srcOffset.z)} $must equal the subresource depth. Similarily if the {@code dstImage} is compressed and if {@code extent.width} is
		not a multiple of the block width then {@code (extent.width + dstOffset.x)} $must equal the subresource width, if {@code extent.height} is not a
		multiple of the block height then {@code (extent.height + dstOffset.y)} $must equal the subresource height and if {@code extent.depth} is not a
		multiple of the block depth then {@code (extent.depth + dstOffset.z)} $must equal the subresource depth. This allows the last block of the image in
		each non-multiple dimension to be included as a source or target of the copy.
